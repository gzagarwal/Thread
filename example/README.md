Here we cover multiple scenarios.

1 . How to make sure Independent threads we can have more control.
2.  There will be a blocking of specified time period .and then start processing next set of threds. 
3.  After that we can decide do we need to continue or stop processing in between .
    Two options we have:
   1. Interrupt Threads
   2. Make the thread as daemon.
